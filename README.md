## This space is for someone who wants to learn LBM Hands-on
## LBM can be applied to lot of areas
## This covers my journey , solvers developed so far
## I would suggest you to start with solving diffusion equation
## Later do isothermal flows like couette flow , flow in channel with various bc , lid driven cavity
## flow past single , multiple obstalces of various shapes

This is to learn to solve diffusion equation using LBM
