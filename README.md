This space is for someone who wants to learn LBM Hands-on.

This covers my journey , solvers developed by me.

LBM can be applied to lot of areas.

I would suggest begineer to start with solving diffusion equation.

Later do isothermal flows like couette flow , flow in channel with various boundary conditions , lid driven cavity
flow past single , multiple obstalces of various shapes

Move to non-isothermal flows starting with natural convection/Rayleigh bernard convection , forced convection , mixed convection

Than I moved to aeroacoustics , slip flows , MHD natural convection , electro kinetic flows , EHD , ETHD , conjugate heat transfer, Double diffusive natural convection.

Can LBM do turbulent flows or turbulence modelling ?

Yes , It is not as hard as traditional turbulence modelling.

It can do LES , k-epsilon 

Doing flow of non-newtonian /power law  fluid is similar to turbulence modelling.
Viscosity/relaxation is computed locally using strain rate tensor (which happens to be second order moment)
One more advantage is avoiding computing velocity gradients

There are lot more areas left to be explored by me ,be it multiphase ,multicomponent flows , flow in porous media , image processing

Writing report for all my work is also on my to do list.
