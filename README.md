This space is for someone who wants to learn LBM Hands-on

LBM can be applied to lot of areas.

This covers my journey , solvers developed by me.

I would suggest you to start with solving diffusion equation.

Later do isothermal flows like couette flow , flow in channel with various bc , lid driven cavity
flow past single , multiple obstalces of various shapes

Move to non-isothermal flows starting with natural convection/Rayleigh bernard convection , forced convection , mixed convection

Than I moved to aeroacoustics , slip flows , MHD natural convection , electro kinetic flows , EHD , ETHD , conjugate heat transfer.

There are lot more areas where it can be applied , next will be taking up multiphase ,multicomponent flows
