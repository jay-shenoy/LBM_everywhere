This space is for someone who wants to learn LBM Hands-on.

This covers my journey , solvers developed by me.

LBM can be applied to lot of areas.
I would suggest begineer to start with solving diffusion equation.

Later do isothermal flows like couette flow , flow in channel with various boundary conditions , lid driven cavity
flow past single , multiple obstalces of various shapes

Move to non-isothermal flows starting with natural convection/Rayleigh bernard convection , forced convection , mixed convection

Than I moved to aeroacoustics , slip flows , MHD natural convection , electro kinetic flows , EHD , ETHD , conjugate heat transfer, Double diffusive natural convection.

There are lot more areas left to be explored by me ,be it multiphase ,multicomponent flows , flow of non-newtonian fluids , flow in porous media , image processing
Writing report for all my work , adding notes will also be done for learners
